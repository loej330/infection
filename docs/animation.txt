how to handle the management of different animation types:
- response to a single press + hold duration:
- active for a certain length of time, then fallback to default animation
- always playing

falling back: - oppinionated and hierarchical

no_animation <- idle-animation <- walking <- turning

the order of falling back if available; ie if walking is active fallback to it,
otherwise go back to the idle animation
