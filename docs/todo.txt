CURRENT TASK:
    2: save data (starting with settings)
CURRENT FOCUS:
    - viruses

Priority levels (1-5) = (important .. unimportant)

FUTURE TASKS:
    1: basic camera tracking to the player
    4: Address cases where variables are being set during a render call when it should just be a variable ACCESS
    4: viewable jump arc
    3: why is clipping is possible in some cases
    3: COLLISION: directly setting player y to the top of a surface should not result in a fall through wall
    3: Definitive determination on how the getting and setting of x and y values should be handled,
        considering x and y values that depend on others
    2: make virus box collision more robust for a moving entity - ie the player
    3: Find out definitively: when should a function be apart of a class?
    2: improve the jump arc
    1: hitbox for the player's 'sack'
    1: pause functionality
    4: address the concern that player state variables and input state is sometimes THE SAME EXACT THING AND MIGHT BE A WASTE OF TIME
        - perhaps the solution is to auto link to a state variable
        - perhaps we need a notion of different input types, HOLD and TOGGLE, and possibly others for 'assumed' behavior
    4: Determine if there is a waste of render calls on things that wont be in the camera space
    4: generalized rendering and collision for all world objects
    3: dont play walking animation when player is pushing against a wall
    4: make 'texture transforms' a functional array
    3: sloped surfaces
    4: line numbers on error messages - might not possible
    3: function curve of momentum, rather than just linear
    5: change the error image into something cooler
    3: variables are better organized inside the world class - perhaps split into individual classes
    2: finish jump animation
    4: fill in the character linework with COLOR
    5: look into progmatically changing the color of assets:
        - should this be real time, or generated ahead of time
        - what if I want to tweak the color scheme while the game is running?

COMPLETED TASKS:

9-13-24
    2. make numbering system work with camera zoom
9-12-24
    1. make it possible for player to hold and drop virus
9-11-24
    1. re-implement turning animation
Before tracking dates
    2. basic inheritence so that functions like get_x1() dont need to be copy pasted all the time
    2. refactor player so it matches syntax with surface or just have inheritance
    - line to indicate where and how far player is about to suck/spit
    - sucker surface colision
    - visual needle hitbox
    - bring numbering back to the grid
    - walking animation errors
    - activate walking animation when hitting the ground and LR key is already being pressed in the air
    - Proper LR Handleing
    - make the external libraries have equivilent behavior as if they were all in game.py
    - seperate main code chunks into files
    - bring back player texture after making hitbox the main THANG
    - camera
    - better implementation of hit boxes so that it makes sense
    - left and right colisions
    - Debug world not resetting on r
    - SEE IF POSSIBLE: make player floor collision GENERIC so that it can 'look down' at aynthing and know if it is on a surface
    - make hitbox the main THANG
    - distinction between world coordinates and game coordinates (moving 10 units in the world should be consistent accorss zoom levels)
